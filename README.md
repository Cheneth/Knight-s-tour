Knight's tour solution finder

Depending on where the starting point is set (grid root is the top left), it takes about 10-15 minutes to find the first solution.

Solutions tend to come in bunches so once one is found a few more are found with it.

There is a prompt and the user needs to input any string to have the program keep searching for a solution.
